# Fetch API

Fetch API is sub-module in FrontEnd, which is responsible to make any calls to the backend. Thus the name Fetch.
Fetch is a multi-purpose API that doesn't have any prior knowledge about the payload that the server is going to send.
You are instructing it to treat the payload as JSON by using the .json() function.
